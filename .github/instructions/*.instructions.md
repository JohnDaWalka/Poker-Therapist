1. Configure the Poker Therapist application to authenticate using your organization-managed Microsoft Windows account in accordance with your institution's security policies.
2. Configure single sign-on (SSO) using your institutional email account (for example, your `ctstate.edu` account) so that users can securely access the application.
3. Set up OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect integration with your Google account to allow the application to connect securely to approved external APIs hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
4. If required, configure additional identity providers (for example, Apple ID or other approved providers) following your organization's credential management and privacy guidelines. Do not store raw credentials or passwords in this document or in source control.
5. Verify that all configured credentials work end-to-end by deploying the application to a test environment and confirming that authentication, authorization, and all automated actions (such as CI/CD workflows or container deployments) complete successfully.
